> Typically when we see this problem, it's caused by a
> conflict between multiple versions of R installed on your
> computer. We recommend in this case navigating to the
> folder `/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/` and
> removing any versions of R that you don't wish to use
> (you can move them to another folder if you think you
> might want to use them later).
